What is Megalith? A ten year plan... A distributed "operating system" for the datacenter, the cloud, the entire internet... An idealized design... A series of iterations in a direction... The past 10 years of Jeff Lindsay, and the next 10 years of Jeff Lindsay. We discuss what it is, what it could be, and where it's headed.
